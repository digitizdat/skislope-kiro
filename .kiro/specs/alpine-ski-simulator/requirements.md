# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Alpine Ski Slope Environment Viewer is a browser-based 3D application that provides realistic ski slope scenery by utilizing real topographical data and satellite imagery from ski areas around the world. Users can define custom ski run boundaries by drawing on satellite maps, creating a personalized database of specific slopes to explore. The system uses independent agent servers to extract hill metrics, equipment data, weather conditions, and other auxiliary information to create an immersive virtual viewing experience focused on user-defined run areas. This project serves as a foundation for a larger system that will simulate FIS World Cup alpine skiing events.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a skiing enthusiast, I want to inspect realistic 3D representations of specific ski run areas that I define, so that I can experience precise slope sections from famous ski areas around the world without traveling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a defined ski run THEN the system SHALL load and render the 3D terrain based on real topographical data within the run boundaries
2. WHEN the terrain is rendered THEN the system SHALL display accurate elevation changes, slope angles, and terrain features only for the defined run area
3. WHEN the user navigates the slope THEN the system SHALL provide smooth 3D movement that follows the terrain contours within the run boundaries
4. IF topographical data is unavailable for a selected run area THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN rendering the run area THEN the system SHALL focus the 3D view on the defined boundaries rather than the entire mountain

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want natural environmental physics and camera controls, so that the simulation feels authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weather indicates wind THEN the system SHALL respond with physics-based tree and snow movement including acceleration, deceleration, and change of direction
2. WHEN the environmental information indicates different terrain types THEN the system SHALL adjust light, reflection, and texture accordingly (powder, ice, groomed runs)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to define and select specific ski runs within ski areas using satellite imagery, so that I can create and explore precise run boundaries that I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a ski area THEN the system SHALL display a satellite map interface with topographical overlay for that area
2. WHEN the user views the satellite map THEN the system SHALL provide drawing tools to trace boundaries around visible ski runs
3. WHEN the user draws a run boundary THEN the system SHALL allow them to name the run and add metadata (difficulty, estimated length, notes)
4. WHEN the user saves a run THEN the system SHALL store the geographic boundary coordinates and metadata for future use
5. WHEN the user accesses saved runs THEN the system SHALL display a list of previously defined runs with preview information
6. IF a saved run is selected THEN the system SHALL transition to the 3D simulation environment within 10 seconds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want immersive visual and audio feedback, so that the environmental experience feels realistic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing THEN the system SHALL render realistic snow effects, lighting, and weather conditions
2. WHEN the camera moves THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate audio feedback including wind sounds
3. WHEN environmental conditions change THEN the system SHALL update visual and audio elements accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to efficiently process and render topographical data, so that performance remains smooth during simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading topographical data THEN the system SHALL process and optimize the data for real-time 3D rendering
2. WHEN rendering the 3D environment THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum of 30 FPS on supported hardware
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds safe limits THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail optimization to maintain performance
4. IF topographical data is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive controls for navigation and camera movement, so that I can easily control my viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides keyboard/controller input THEN the system SHALL translate input to camera movements
2. WHEN the user adjusts camera settings THEN the system SHALL provide multiple view options (first-person, third-person, cinematic)
3. IF the user wants to restart or change slopes THEN the system SHALL provide accessible menu options during gameplay

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from specific world-renowned ski areas and then define custom runs within those areas, so that I can explore precise slope sections at my preferred performance level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the start page THEN the system SHALL display five ski area options: Chamonix, Whistler, Saint Anton am Arlberg, Zermatt, and Copper Mountain
2. WHEN the user selects a ski area THEN the system SHALL provide options to either create new runs or select from existing saved runs
3. WHEN the user chooses to create a new run THEN the system SHALL display the satellite map interface for run boundary definition
4. WHEN the user selects an existing run THEN the system SHALL provide terrain detail options from 32x32 to 128x128 grid cells for that specific run area
5. WHEN the user chooses a detail level THEN the system SHALL render only the defined run area with the corresponding grid resolution
6. WHEN higher detail levels are selected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate performance warnings if the user's hardware may struggle

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive map-based tools to define ski run boundaries on satellite imagery, so that I can precisely select the areas I want to explore in 3D.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the map interface THEN the system SHALL display high-resolution satellite imagery of the selected ski area
2. WHEN viewing the satellite map THEN the system SHALL overlay topographical contour lines to show elevation changes
3. WHEN the user wants to define a run THEN the system SHALL provide polygon drawing tools to trace run boundaries
4. WHEN drawing boundaries THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the selected area and estimated dimensions
5. WHEN the user completes a boundary THEN the system SHALL calculate and display run statistics (length, vertical drop, average slope)
6. WHEN saving a run THEN the system SHALL require a name and allow optional metadata (difficulty rating, surface type, notes)
7. WHEN managing runs THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit, delete, or duplicate existing run definitions
8. IF the defined area is too large for performance THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest smaller boundaries

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want independent agent servers to provide auxiliary data via standardized protocols, so that the system can be extended and integrated with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser requests hill metrics THEN independent agent servers SHALL provide topographical analysis via JSON-RPC over HTTP
2. WHEN the browser requests weather data THEN agent servers SHALL provide current and historical weather conditions via JSON-RPC over HTTP
3. WHEN the browser requests equipment metrics THEN agent servers SHALL provide ski equipment and infrastructure data via JSON-RPC over HTTP
