# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Alpine Ski Slope Environment Viewer is a browser-based 3D application that provides realistic ski slope scenery by utilizing real topographical data from ski slopes around the world. The system uses independent agent servers to extract hill metrics, equipment data, weather conditions, and other auxiliary information to create an immersive virtual viewing experience. This project serves as a foundation for a larger system that will simulate FIS World Cup alpine skiing events.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a skiing enthusiast, I want to inspect realistic 3D representations of real-world ski slopes, so that I can experience famous ski runs from around the world without traveling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a ski slope THEN the system SHALL load and render the 3D terrain based on real topographical data
2. WHEN the terrain is rendered THEN the system SHALL display accurate elevation changes, slope angles, and terrain features
3. WHEN the user navigates the slope THEN the system SHALL provide smooth 3D movement that follows the terrain contours
4. IF topographical data is unavailable for a selected slope THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want natural environmental physics and camera controls, so that the simulation feels authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weather indicates wind THEN the system SHALL respond with physics-based tree and snow movement including acceleration, deceleration, and change of direction
2. WHEN the environmental information indicates different terrain types THEN the system SHALL adjust light, reflection, and texture accordingly (powder, ice, groomed runs)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose from multiple real ski slopes from different locations, so that I can experience variety in my skiing simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the slope selection interface THEN the system SHALL display a list of available ski slopes with location information
2. WHEN the user selects a slope THEN the system SHALL load the corresponding topographical data and metadata
3. WHEN displaying slope options THEN the system SHALL show preview information including difficulty level, vertical drop, and length
4. IF a slope is selected THEN the system SHALL transition to the 3D simulation environment within 10 seconds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want immersive visual and audio feedback, so that the environmental experience feels realistic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing THEN the system SHALL render realistic snow effects, lighting, and weather conditions
2. WHEN the camera moves THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate audio feedback including wind sounds
3. WHEN environmental conditions change THEN the system SHALL update visual and audio elements accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to efficiently process and render topographical data, so that performance remains smooth during simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading topographical data THEN the system SHALL process and optimize the data for real-time 3D rendering
2. WHEN rendering the 3D environment THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum of 30 FPS on supported hardware
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds safe limits THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail optimization to maintain performance
4. IF topographical data is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive controls for navigation and camera movement, so that I can easily control my viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides keyboard/controller input THEN the system SHALL translate input to camera movements
2. WHEN the user adjusts camera settings THEN the system SHALL provide multiple view options (first-person, third-person, cinematic)
3. IF the user wants to restart or change slopes THEN the system SHALL provide accessible menu options during gameplay

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from specific world-renowned ski areas with configurable detail levels, so that I can explore famous slopes at my preferred performance level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the start page THEN the system SHALL display five ski area options: Chamonix, Whistler, Saint Anton am Arlberg, Zermatt, and Copper Mountain
2. WHEN the user selects a ski area THEN the system SHALL provide terrain detail options from 32x32 to 128x128 grid cells
3. WHEN the user chooses a detail level THEN the system SHALL render the terrain with the corresponding grid resolution
4. WHEN higher detail levels are selected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate performance warnings if the user's hardware may struggle

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want independent agent servers to provide auxiliary data via standardized protocols, so that the system can be extended and integrated with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser requests hill metrics THEN independent agent servers SHALL provide topographical analysis via JSON-RPC over HTTP
2. WHEN the browser requests weather data THEN agent servers SHALL provide current and historical weather conditions via JSON-RPC over HTTP
3. WHEN the browser requests equipment metrics THEN agent servers SHALL provide ski equipment and infrastructure data via JSON-RPC over HTTP
4. WHEN external tools need to integrate THEN agent servers SHALL support the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for compatibility
5. IF an agent server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and provide fallback data

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want this system to serve as a foundation for FIS World Cup simulation, so that it can be extended for competitive skiing event simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system architecture THEN the system SHALL be built with extensibility for competitive skiing simulation
2. WHEN storing terrain data THEN the system SHALL maintain data structures compatible with FIS World Cup course specifications
3. WHEN implementing agent communication THEN the system SHALL support data types relevant to competitive skiing (timing, course markers, safety zones)
4. WHEN building the rendering engine THEN the system SHALL support features needed for race simulation (gates, timing systems, spectator areas)
