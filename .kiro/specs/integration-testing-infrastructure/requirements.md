# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Integration Testing Infrastructure ensures the Alpine Ski Slope Environment Viewer system maintains reliability and prevents regressions through comprehensive end-to-end testing. This system validates API contracts between frontend and backend agents, verifies cross-system communication protocols, and catches environment configuration issues before deployment. The testing infrastructure addresses the critical need for automated validation of the complex multi-agent architecture, preventing issues like missing API methods, CORS configuration problems, and dependency management failures that could break the user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated API contract testing between frontend and backend agents, so that method signature mismatches and missing endpoints are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration tests run THEN the system SHALL verify that all frontend AgentClient method calls correspond to existing backend JSON-RPC methods
2. WHEN testing API contracts THEN the system SHALL validate method names, parameter structures, and response formats for hill metrics, weather, and equipment agents
3. WHEN an API method is missing or renamed THEN the integration tests SHALL fail with clear error messages indicating the specific contract violation
4. WHEN new API methods are added THEN the integration tests SHALL require corresponding frontend client updates before passing
5. IF agent servers are unavailable during testing THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostics about connectivity issues versus contract failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive cross-system communication testing, so that CORS configuration, network protocols, and data serialization work correctly across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing cross-origin requests THEN the system SHALL verify CORS headers allow frontend-to-agent communication from all expected origins
2. WHEN validating JSON-RPC protocol THEN the system SHALL test request/response serialization, error handling, and protocol compliance
3. WHEN testing MCP protocol support THEN the system SHALL verify agent servers correctly implement Model Context Protocol for external tool integration
4. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL test graceful degradation and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN data transfer is large THEN the system SHALL verify streaming and chunked transfer capabilities work correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated environment validation testing, so that dependency issues, SSL problems, and package manager conflicts are detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running environment tests THEN the system SHALL verify all Python dependencies are correctly installed via uv package manager
2. WHEN testing SSL connectivity THEN the system SHALL validate HTTPS requests work correctly in the target deployment environment
3. WHEN checking package consistency THEN the system SHALL detect mixed package manager usage (pip vs uv) and fail with remediation instructions
4. WHEN validating imports THEN the system SHALL test that all agent modules can be imported successfully before running functional tests
5. IF environment issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific diagnostic information and suggested fixes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end workflow testing, so that complete user scenarios work correctly from frontend interaction through agent processing to data display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing terrain loading workflow THEN the system SHALL simulate complete user interaction from run selection through 3D rendering
2. WHEN validating cache integration THEN the system SHALL test offline mode functionality and cache invalidation scenarios
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify graceful handling of agent failures, network issues, and invalid data
4. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL validate response times meet requirements under various load conditions
5. WHEN testing data consistency THEN the system SHALL verify terrain data, weather information, and equipment status remain synchronized

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast feedback integration testing, so that test results are available quickly during development without blocking the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL complete basic API contract validation within 30 seconds
2. WHEN testing in CI/CD pipeline THEN the system SHALL provide parallel test execution to minimize build time
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback with specific failure reasons and suggested fixes
4. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL support selective test execution for specific components or scenarios
5. IF agents need to be started for testing THEN the system SHALL handle agent lifecycle management automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test reporting and monitoring, so that test results provide actionable insights for maintaining system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports showing pass/fail status for each test category
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture relevant logs, network traces, and system state for debugging
3. WHEN monitoring test trends THEN the system SHALL track test execution times and failure patterns over time
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL verify and report on system health metrics and performance benchmarks
5. IF test infrastructure itself fails THEN the system SHALL distinguish between infrastructure issues and application failures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration test coverage for offline and degraded scenarios, so that the system remains functional when external dependencies are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent servers are offline THEN the integration tests SHALL verify the frontend gracefully falls back to cached data
2. WHEN network connectivity is intermittent THEN the system SHALL test retry mechanisms and partial failure handling
3. WHEN cache is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL verify appropriate error handling and user feedback
4. WHEN only some agents are available THEN the system SHALL test partial functionality scenarios
5. IF external data sources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL verify fallback data mechanisms work correctly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want deployment validation testing, so that production deployments are verified to work correctly before users access the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the integration tests SHALL run smoke tests against the live environment
2. WHEN validating deployment THEN the system SHALL test all critical user paths work with production data and configuration
3. WHEN checking production readiness THEN the system SHALL verify performance meets requirements under expected load
4. WHEN monitoring production health THEN the system SHALL provide continuous integration testing for early problem detection
5. IF production issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide automated rollback triggers and incident response data
