# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Realistic Terrain Data Sources enhancement addresses the critical issue of unrealistic terrain rendering in the Alpine Ski Simulator. Currently, the system generates synthetic terrain using mathematical functions, resulting in terrain that doesn't resemble actual ski slopes. This enhancement will replace synthetic data generation with real Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from authoritative sources, providing authentic topographical representation of world-renowned ski areas. The system will integrate multiple high-resolution data sources, implement intelligent data source selection based on geographic location, and optimize terrain processing for realistic ski slope characteristics.
