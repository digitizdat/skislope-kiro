# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Frontend Test Environment Setup ensures that all frontend unit and integration tests run reliably in both local development and CI/CD environments. This addresses critical issues preventing the pre-push hook from succeeding, including WebGL context initialization, IndexedDB mocking, CacheManager initialization, and proper async operation handling in test environments. The system must provide a robust testing foundation that allows developers to confidently validate frontend functionality without browser dependencies or external service requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WebGL context properly initialized in headless test environments, so that Three.js rendering tests pass without requiring a physical display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Three.js tests in headless mode THEN the system SHALL provide a valid WebGL context using the canvas package
2. WHEN testing 3D rendering components THEN the system SHALL mock WebGL operations without requiring GPU hardware
3. WHEN ThreeSetup tests execute THEN the system SHALL successfully create WebGL renderers, scenes, and cameras in the test environment
4. WHEN testing terrain rendering THEN the system SHALL validate mesh generation and material application without visual output
5. IF WebGL context creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating missing canvas package or configuration issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CacheManager properly mocked and initialized in test environments, so that services depending on IndexedDB operations work correctly during testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing services that use CacheManager THEN the system SHALL provide a fully mocked IndexedDB implementation
2. WHEN CacheManager initialization is required THEN the system SHALL automatically set up mock storage without manual intervention
3. WHEN testing cache operations THEN the system SHALL simulate get, set, delete, and clear operations with appropriate async behavior
4. WHEN testing offline scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide controllable cache states for testing different data availability conditions
5. IF cache operations fail in tests THEN the system SHALL distinguish between mock setup issues and actual logic errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper async operation handling in test environments, so that timeouts and race conditions don't cause false test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeout values for test environment performance
2. WHEN testing Promise-based services THEN the system SHALL properly await all async operations before test completion
3. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions and provide deterministic test results
4. WHEN async operations take longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide clear timeout error messages with debugging information
5. IF async tests are flaky THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for controlling timing and execution order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test utilities and mocks for browser APIs, so that frontend services can be tested without browser dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing services that use browser APIs THEN the system SHALL provide mocks for localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB
2. WHEN testing network operations THEN the system SHALL mock fetch API and XMLHttpRequest with controllable responses
3. WHEN testing file operations THEN the system SHALL provide mock File and Blob APIs for testing data processing
4. WHEN testing audio services THEN the system SHALL mock Web Audio API without requiring audio hardware
5. IF browser API mocks are incomplete THEN the system SHALL fail tests with clear messages about missing mock implementations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test environment configuration that matches production behavior, so that tests accurately validate real-world functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring test environment THEN the system SHALL use the same TypeScript configuration as production builds
2. WHEN testing module imports THEN the system SHALL resolve dependencies using the same path resolution as the build system
3. WHEN testing environment variables THEN the system SHALL provide consistent configuration between test and production environments
4. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic error conditions that match production scenarios
5. IF test environment differs from production THEN the system SHALL document and justify any necessary differences

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast and reliable test execution, so that the pre-push hook completes quickly without blocking development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running frontend tests THEN the system SHALL complete all tests within 60 seconds on standard development hardware
2. WHEN tests are executed in parallel THEN the system SHALL prevent resource conflicts and ensure test isolation
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback with specific failure reasons and file locations
4. WHEN running subset of tests THEN the system SHALL support filtering by file pattern, test name, or component category
5. IF test performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide profiling information to identify bottlenecks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code paths and maintain quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports showing line, branch, and function coverage percentages
2. WHEN coverage is below thresholds THEN the system SHALL fail the test run with specific information about uncovered code
3. WHEN new code is added THEN the system SHALL require corresponding tests to maintain coverage levels
4. WHEN testing complex components THEN the system SHALL provide detailed coverage analysis for conditional logic and error paths
5. IF coverage reporting fails THEN the system SHALL continue test execution but warn about missing coverage data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration between frontend tests and the CI/CD pipeline, so that test failures prevent broken code from being merged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the pre-push hook SHALL run all frontend tests and block push on failures
2. WHEN tests fail in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and artifacts for debugging
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate and store test artifacts for deployment validation
4. WHEN test environment setup fails THEN the system SHALL distinguish between setup issues and actual test failures
5. IF CI/CD test execution differs from local THEN the system SHALL provide tools for reproducing CI/CD environment locally
