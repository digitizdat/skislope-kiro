# Vitest Configuration Summary

## Task 6: Configure Vitest for optimal frontend testing

This document summarizes the Vitest configuration implemented for optimal frontend testing.

## Configuration Features

### Environment Settings
- **Environment**: jsdom for DOM simulation
- **Globals**: Enabled for global test functions
- **Setup Files**: Integrated with existing test setup infrastructure

### Timeout Configuration
- **Global Timeout**: 10,000ms for test suites
- **Test Timeout**: 5,000ms for individual tests
- **Hook Timeout**: 10,000ms for setup/teardown operations

### Parallel Execution & Isolation
- **Pool**: Worker threads for parallel execution
- **Isolation**: Enabled for test environment isolation
- **Thread Safety**: Atomic operations enabled
- **Single Thread**: Disabled to enable parallel execution

### Coverage Reporting
- **Provider**: v8 for accurate coverage
- **Reporters**: text, json, html, lcov formats
- **Thresholds**: 80% for lines, functions, branches, statements
- **Directory**: ./coverage for coverage reports
- **Exclusions**: Test files, config files, node_modules

### Test File Management
- **Include Patterns**: All test files in src/ directory
- **Exclude Patterns**: node_modules, dist, .git, coverage
- **Output Files**: JSON and HTML reports in test-results/

### Performance & Debugging
- **Memory Monitoring**: Heap usage tracking enabled
- **Log Heap Usage**: Enabled for performance monitoring
- **Allow Only**: Enabled for development (test.only)
- **Pass With No Tests**: Disabled to catch missing tests

### Environment Variables
- **NODE_ENV**: Set to 'test'
- **VITEST**: Set to 'true' for test detection

### Path Resolution
- **Aliases**: Matches production build configuration
- **Module Resolution**: Consistent with Vite build system

## New Package.json Scripts

- `test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage reporting
- `test:performance` - Run tests with memory monitoring
- `test:filter` - Run filtered tests with verbose output

## Verification

The configuration has been verified to:
- ✅ Generate coverage reports with proper thresholds
- ✅ Support parallel test execution with isolation
- ✅ Provide proper timeout handling for async operations
- ✅ Generate JSON and HTML test reports
- ✅ Monitor memory usage during test execution
- ✅ Pass all precommit checks
- ✅ Maintain compatibility with existing test infrastructure

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 5.2**: Test environment matches production configuration
- **Requirement 6.1**: Fast test execution under 60 seconds
- **Requirement 6.2**: Parallel execution with test isolation

## Files Modified

- `vitest.config.ts` - Main configuration file
- `package.json` - Added new test scripts
- `test-results/` - Created directory for test reports
- `coverage/` - Created directory for coverage reports

## Next Steps

This configuration provides the foundation for:
- Task 7: Create async operation test utilities
- Task 8: Fix TerrainService test failures
- Task 9: Fix ThreeSetup test failures
- Task 10: Fix AgentClient test failures
- Task 11: Fix CacheManager test timeout issues
