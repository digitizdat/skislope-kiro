# Browser API Mock Fixes Summary

## Problem
The pre-push hook was being blocked by 3 failing browser API mock tests that were preventing code pushes.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. WebGL Canvas Mock Issue
- **Problem**: The WebGL context's `canvas` property was not properly pointing back to the canvas element that created it
- **Root Cause**: The canvas mock was shared across all `document.createElement('canvas')` calls, but the WebGL context was cached and not properly linked to each specific canvas instance
- **Solution**: Modified the canvas creation to use a factory function that creates unique canvas instances, and ensured each WebGL context properly references its creating canvas

### 2. File/Blob ArrayBuffer Conversion Issue  
- **Problem**: When creating a File from a Blob containing Uint8Array data, the `arrayBuffer()` method was returning zeros instead of the actual data
- **Root Cause**: The Blob mock wasn't properly handling nested Blob objects when passed to the File constructor, and the data wasn't being preserved through the conversion chain
- **Solution**: Enhanced the Blob mock to store original data in a `_mockData` property and properly extract data from nested Blob objects during File construction

### 3. Fetch Response URL Issue
- **Problem**: The fetch mock was returning an empty string for the `response.url` property instead of the actual request URL
- **Root Cause**: The response creation logic was using `responseData.url ?? url` which would use the empty default URL from responseData instead of the actual request URL
- **Solution**: Changed the logic to always use the actual request URL: `url` instead of `responseData.url ?? url`

### 4. Deprecated `done()` Callback Issues
- **Problem**: Several tests were using the deprecated Vitest `done()` callback pattern, causing uncaught exceptions
- **Root Cause**: Vitest deprecated the `done()` callback in favor of promises and async/await
- **Solution**: Converted all affected tests to use Promise-based patterns with proper error handling

## Files Modified

### Core Mock Implementation
- `src/test/browserAPIMocks.ts` - Fixed fetch URL handling and Blob/File data preservation
- `src/test/testSetup.ts` - Fixed WebGL canvas mock to properly link canvas and context

### Test Files  
- `src/test/browserAPIIntegration.test.ts` - Converted deprecated `done()` callbacks to promises
- `src/test/browserAPIMocks.test.ts` - Converted deprecated `done()` callbacks to promises

## Results

### Before Fixes
- 3 failing tests blocking all code pushes
- Additional uncaught exceptions from deprecated callback usage
- Pre-push hook failing consistently

### After Fixes  
- ✅ All 259 frontend unit tests passing
- ✅ Pre-push hook running successfully
- ✅ No more blocking issues for code pushes
- ✅ Browser API mocks working correctly for:
  - WebGL canvas context creation
  - File/Blob ArrayBuffer operations
  - Fetch response URL handling
  - XMLHttpRequest lifecycle
  - IndexedDB operations

## Impact
- **Developers can now push code without being blocked by test failures**
- **Frontend test environment is fully functional and reliable**
- **Browser API mocks provide comprehensive coverage for headless testing**
- **Pre-push hook successfully validates code quality before pushes**

## Technical Details

### WebGL Canvas Fix
```typescript
// Before: Shared canvas with incorrect context linking
const mockCanvas = { /* shared instance */ };

// After: Factory function creating unique canvas instances
const createMockCanvas = () => {
  const canvas = { /* unique instance */ };
  canvas.getContext = (type) => {
    const context = createWebGLContextMock();
    context.canvas = canvas; // Proper back-reference
    return context;
  };
  return canvas;
};
```

### Blob/File Data Preservation Fix
```typescript
// Before: Data lost during Blob->File conversion
MockBlob.call(this, parts, options);

// After: Data preserved through _mockData property
const storedData = combineDataChunks(parts);
(this as any)._mockData = storedData;
this.arrayBuffer = () => Promise.resolve(storedData.buffer);
```

### Fetch URL Fix
```typescript
// Before: Empty URL returned
url: responseData.url ?? url,

// After: Actual request URL returned  
url: url,
```

This comprehensive fix ensures the frontend test environment is robust and reliable for ongoing development.
